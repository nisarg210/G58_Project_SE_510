But the videos is way too long and the audio quality could have been better. Moreover, for an repo to look good, the introductory video should be on the top, while in this project, the introductory video comes after the video which shows changes made in the project                                                                
Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2     | workload does not seem to be equally spread as some of the team members have bigger contributions to the codebase.
